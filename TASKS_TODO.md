MAJOR:
- How can we tie the scores.bin file entries to the song name? Is using the songcache file the best approach? If so, figure out that format better
- Cover more/all scenarios of files (ie: more instrument scores, special chars,...)


MINOR:
- Apply more and better validation everywhere
- Progressbars maybe?
- Searching?
