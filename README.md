Core functionality, features and UI may still change drastically.
<strong>You should also expect this program to possibly break/delete/corrupt your save files, proceed with caution, make the needed backups. You have been warned!</strong>

Written in C# with WPF.
You'll need Visual Studio(2019) to build the project yourself.
