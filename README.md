I fully expect this program to break/delete/corrupt your save files, proceed with caution, make the needed backups. You have been warned!


You'll need Visual Studio(2019) to build the project.

Some alpha releases are available.

Pull requests are welcome, as well as feedback or feature requests. If you find (reproducible) issues, please submit them, thanks!
