<strong>Clone Hero Save Game Editor</strong> is a tiny Windows application to modify your Clone Hero save file. You can change individual parameters for each high score for each individual song. If you want to 'reset' individual scores, jump up in difficulty level or previously used an easier modifier and now want see your high scores increase again over time, you can easily lower or change your score to be able to beat it again.

<strong>Currently the editor may not fully support every possible save file (too complex, too many scores,...). The program does a format validation check when reading in your file to validate this. Backup files are created when saving in case something still goes wrong. There is barely any validation in the editor yet, if you mess up the input it will break your file.</strong>

Core functionality, features and UI may still change drastically.
<strong>You should also expect this program to possibly break/delete/corrupt your save files, proceed with caution, make the needed backups. You have been warned!</strong>

Written in C# with WPF.
You'll need Visual Studio(2019) to build the project yourself.

Some alpha releases are available on the <a href="https://github.com/matthiasduyck/CloneHeroSaveGameEditor/releases">releases page.</a>
